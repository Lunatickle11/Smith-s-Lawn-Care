  <p> If you're unfamailar with how pricing works in the lawncare service, here is a bit information to help you better understand.
    <br>
    <br> Pricing varies on multiple factors, including yard size, types of services you want, and the amount of overall work needed to be done. For example, if your lawn is larger, the price will increase, but if it's smaller than average, then it will
    be cheaper. Simple! If you would like more than a lawn trimming, then the price will increase a bit more. The cost of the extra service you would like also affects the total. Here are a few examples if you are still a little lost. (Prices are not
    accurate. They are just for reference)
